## FreeCAD GSoC 2024 Final Report: Implementation of Semi-Analytical Finite Element in FreeCAD for Pavement Infrastructure Modeling

## Kairen Shen 08/25/2024

### Introduction

This report summarizes the completion of the SAFEM software's core development and outlines the next steps for integrating it with FreeCAD. The SAFEM (Semi-Analytical Finite Element Method) will serve as a robust alternative to external FEM modules within FreeCAD, particularly for pavement infrastructure modeling.

### Software Architecture

The core architecture of SAFEM, which has been completed, provides a powerful computational engine for finite element analysis. The integration with FreeCAD will be conducted in three stages:
1. **Python Script Integration**: Facilitate data exchange between FreeCAD and SAFEM.
2. **Macro Development**: Create macros to automate common tasks and streamline the SAFEM workflow within FreeCAD.
3. **Workbench Implementation**: Develop a dedicated workbench in FreeCAD for SAFEM, providing a user-friendly interface and seamless experience.

### Current Progress

1. **Completion of SAFEM Core**:
    - The SAFEM computation core, responsible for performing finite element analysis, has been fully implemented.
    - The core includes functionalities for meshing, material properties, boundary conditions, and solving the finite element equations.

2. **Integration Steps**: (ongoing)
    - **Python Script**: Scripts will be developed to handle the transfer of data between FreeCAD and SAFEM. This will enable the integration of FreeCAD's modeling capabilities with SAFEM's computational power.
    - **Macro**: Macros will be created to simplify repetitive tasks and allow users to quickly set up and run SAFEM analyses within FreeCAD.
    - **Workbench**: A new workbench in FreeCAD will be designed to encapsulate the SAFEM functionalities, offering a specialized UI and workflow tailored to pavement infrastructure modeling.

### Workflow

1. **Model Creation in FreeCAD**:
    - Users will create models in FreeCAD, defining dimensions, material properties, and other necessary parameters.

2. **Data Transfer and Computation**:
    - Python scripts will facilitate the transfer of model data to SAFEM for finite element computation.
    - The SAFEM core will process the data, execute the analysis, and return the results.

3. **Result Visualization in FreeCAD**:
    - The computed results will be visualized in FreeCAD, providing users with a comprehensive view of the analysis outcomes.

### Conclusion

With the SAFEM core now complete, the focus will shift to integrating this powerful computational engine with FreeCAD. The planned stages—Python scripts, macros, and a dedicated workbench—will ensure that SAFEM becomes a fully integrated part of FreeCAD, offering a streamlined and efficient workflow for finite element analysis in pavement infrastructure modeling.

### Future Work

- **Python Script Development**: Implement scripts to manage data flow between FreeCAD and SAFEM.
- **Macro Creation**: Develop macros to automate SAFEM tasks within FreeCAD.
- **Workbench Implementation**: Design and integrate a SAFEM-specific workbench in FreeCAD, enhancing user experience and functionality.
